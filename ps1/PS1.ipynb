    "The Barnes-Hut (BH) idea is quite simple. First, we separate our particles in a quad-tree structure of particle groups. If the group on some tree level is sufficiently far away from a certain particle, we can approximate its potential by using its center of mass. If it is not, we compute its influence recursively by using lower tree levels. The accuracy of the Barnes-Hut algorithm depends on the choise of parameter $\\theta = s / d$, where $s$ is the width of the region represented by the internal node, and $d$ is the distance between the body and the node's center-of-mass.\n",

Put there also a list of children (there are not so many of them for quad-tree, no more than $2^d$), each child is set to be another TreeNode (if the node is a leaf, its children array is empty). \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are $N=4^K, K \\in N$ particles. If the number of particles is not a power of $4$, then we claim that the tree for $4^{Ceil(\\text{log}_4N)}$ is not smaller than one constructed from $N$ particles, so we can round $N$ to closest(on the right) power of $4$ and obtain a valid upper bound.
